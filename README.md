################### OVERVIEW ###########################
The Parq framework has been developed and currently in use at one of my projects am involved , in response to the nature of the SalesForce  internal HTML  structure - namely the lack of unique identifier and name attributes with which to hook 
The framework has explicitly been designed to to circumvent this problem by not using relative and absolute XPATH but instead has developed alternative locator strategies.
